## Features
### The header
At the top of the webpage there is a header section with a logo, and a navigation/menu underneath. The menu helps the user to navigate to three different sections/pages, home(index), cities and contact-me. 
The logo is yellow on a blue background (to symbol the Swedish flag) 
The navigation is in black in an easy to read font. The color on a white background creates good contrast and visibility. 
The header section of the page clearly tells the user the name of the page, its purpose and where they can find the information.

### Footer
the footer has a line of text ensuring the user to have a look at the social media sites for the company. And the logos and links to three different social media platforms. The links opens in a new tab. 

## Testing
### HTML
The links in the Menu (navbar) works form all the pages. The link in the logo that takes you back to the home site works as well. 
The links to the social media platforms in the footer works and opens in new tabs. 
The “contact me” form works when tested. The email area needs to have a proper email address or you cant submit the form. The submission button works and the drop down list shows all four cities.  

### UX

### Deployment
This page was deployed through GitHub Pages

Unfixed bugs
- There is no unfixed bugs. 

### Bugs
- When deploying the link in the logo didn’t work. Solution: Moved the link to the right place in the code. 

## Further development
If I had more time the next step for the page would be to make individual pages for all the cities. So when the user chose a city, the can click on it, get directed to a separate page, and get more information and pictures on the city. 
The site could also benefit from a more advanced and detailed form section, so the user can provide more information to the person that is going to organize the trip.
